Description: Minesweeper package  is a computer implementation of the game,
        providing a user-friendly interface that allows players to
        play the game on their computer. The package includes functions that
        allow users to create new game boards, specify the size of the board,
        and the number of mines to place on the board.
        The user can interact with the game using keyboard or mouse inputs,
        and the package responds by revealing cells or flagging them as containing mines.
        The package also provides visual feedback to the user, showing the state of the
        game board and the cells that have been revealed.
